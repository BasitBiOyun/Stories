    content: `In the Holy Qur’an, the name of Abraham (pbuh)’s father is Azer. He is described as an idol worshipper (see Surah En'âm: 74). Azer is presented in Islamic sources as Nimrod's idol maker. There are different ideas about the birthplace of Abraham (pbuh). Some sources say that he was born in the land of Sumer, Mesopotamia, and migrated from there to Harran. Most generally speaking, we can say that Abraham was born in the city of Ur or Babylon, the country of King Nimrod. Historically, Abraham (pbuh) is believed to have lived in the 20th century BC. Some sources suggest that he lived between 2200–2000 BC. During the time of Abraham (pbuh), the Sumerian/Mesopotamian country was prosperous in many aspects, such as agriculture and industry. Abraham (pbuh)'s message of monotheism was a belief that had existed in these lands before, but it had been forgotten over time. In the time of Abraham (pbuh), Allah was believed to be in the heavens.

People worshipped the planets, stars, sun, and moon; some people worshipped idols of stone and wood; still others worshipped their kings and rulers.`,

    content: `The head of Abraham (pbuh)’s family was an idolater who totally rejected Allah and made idols with his own hands. Abraham (pbuh) was born into that atmosphere and family. Very soon, he was going to fight against his family and the whole system in his society. As a prophet who lived before Jacob (pbuh), Joseph (pbuh), Moses (pbuh), and Jesus (pbuh), Abraham (pbuh) tried to spread the belief in monotheism in the land of Mesopotamia and the lands where he migrated. Nimrod, the king of Babylon, had many fortunetellers and astrologers. One year, around the 20th century BC, they predicted that a child named Abraham (pbuh) would be born in the region, would change the religion of the people, and would end the reign of Nimrod. According to another narration, Nimrod had a dream that a child in the region would challenge his throne. So, he gathered pregnant women in one place and ordered that all male children be killed.

Upon this, Azer took his wife, who was pregnant with Abraham (pbuh), to a safe place and hid her in a cave, where Abraham (pbuh) was born.`,

    content: `Abraham (pbuh) came to know Allah when he was young in age. Allah cleared up Abraham (pbuh)’s heart and mind and gave him wisdom from childhood. Allah said: “And We had certainly given Abraham his sound judgement before, and We were of him well-Knowing" (as to his belief in the Oneness of Allah etc.) (Surah Enbiyâ: 51). During his early childhood, Abraham (pbuh) realized that his father made strange statues, sculptures. One day, he asked his father about what he made. His father replied that he made statues of gods. Abraham (pbuh) was astonished and he spontaneously rejected the idea. Being a child, he played with the statues, sitting on their backs as people sit on the backs of donkeys. One day, his father saw him riding the statue of Mardukh (the Chief God of Babylon) and he became furious. He ordered his son not to play with it again. Abraham (pbuh) asked: "What is this statue, father?

It has big ears, bigger than ours. " His father answered: "It is Mardukh, the god of gods, son!"`,
