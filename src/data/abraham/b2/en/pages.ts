    content: `These big ears show his deep knowledge. " This made Abraham (pbuh) laugh; he was only seven years old at that time.

Years passed and Abraham (pbuh) grew. Since his childhood, his heart was full of hatred for these idols. He could not understand how a reasonable person could make a statue and then worship what he had made. He realized these statues were lifeless, silent, and entirely helpless; when they fell, they could not get back up. It was impossible to understand how people could believe that such statues could harm or benefit them! Abraham (pbuh)'s people had a big temple full of idols, in the middle of which was a niche housing the biggest gods. Abraham (pbuh), who used to go to the temple with his father when he was a child, greatly disliked all that wood and stone. It shocked him to see people bowing, crying, and begging the idols for help, as if those lifeless idols were capable of hearing their prayers! At first, Abraham thought the sight was funny, but later his feelings turned into anger.`,

    content: `Wasn't it shocking that all of those people could be fooled? His father wanted him to become a priest when he grew up, which made things even worse. He only wanted his son to show respect to those statues, yet Abraham (pbuh) never stopped displaying his hatred.

One night, Abraham (pbuh) left his house to go to a mountain. He walked by himself through the darkness until he found a cave in the mountain, where he sat down to rest. He looked at the sky and saw the planets and stars which were worshipped by some people on earth. The Holy Qur’an told this incident in Surah En’âm, verses (âyet) 75–79: “Thus, We showed Abraham the empire of the heavens and the earth, that he might be one of those with certainty. When the night fell over him, he saw a planet. He said, “This is my lord.” But when it set, he said, “I do not love those that set.” Abraham (pbuh) saw that the stars couldn't show up when they wanted to because they could only do so at night.`,

    content: `“Then, when he saw the moon rising, he said, “This is my lord.” But when it set, he said, “If my Lord does not guide me, I will be one of the erring people.” Then, when he saw the sun rising, he said, “This is my lord, this is bigger.” But when it set, he said, “O my people, I am innocent of your idolatry. I have directed my attention towards Him Who created the heavens and the earth—a monotheist—and I am not of the idolaters.” His young heart was filled with severe pain. He considered what was beyond the moon, the stars, and the planets (i.e., Allah). He was astonished that these heavenly bodies were worshipped by people, while in fact all those stars, asteroids, the Sun, the Moon, etc., had been created; they appeared and disappeared at the Creator’s command.

People who worshipped astronomical objects got into arguments with Abraham (pbuh). In that debate, Abraham (pbuh) demonstrated to the people that these heavenly bodies cannot be worshipped as partners with Allah.`,
